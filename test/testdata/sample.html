    <h3><span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 467 525 1386 588'>1 Down the Rabbit-Hole</span></h3>
    <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 461 648 2077 707'>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,</span>
    <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 461 708 2079 766'>and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her</span>
    <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 460 770 2078 826'>sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is</span>
    <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 459 829 1906 884'>the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?</span>
    <p class='ocr_par'>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 533 888 2077 946'>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 459 947 2079 1007'>day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 459 1008 2075 1067'>daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 458 1069 1819 1127'>when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class='ocr_par'>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 531 1130 2077 1185'>There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 458 1189 2077 1247'>VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 457 1249 2076 1305'>dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 456 1308 2076 1363'>her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 456 1366 2075 1425'>quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 456 1428 2074 1486'>ITS WAISTCOAT- POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 456 1490 2074 1540'>started to her feet, for it Hashed across her mind that she had never before</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 455 1549 2075 1607'>seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 455 1609 2073 1666'>burning with curiosity, she ran across the Held after it, and fortunately was</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 452 1668 1897 1725'>just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 528 1727 2074 1786'>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 455 1787 1262 1841'>in the world she was to get out again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class='ocr_par'>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 527 1847 2073 1905'>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 454 1907 2073 1962'>dipped suddenly down, so suddenly     Alice had not a moment to think</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 454 1966 2069 2025'>about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class='ocr_par'>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 527 2027 2072 2086'>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 453 2086 2072 2145'>of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 452 2146 2071 2198'>to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 452 2207 2071 2262'>coming to, but it Was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 451 2265 2070 2323'>of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 451 2325 2071 2384'>shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 451 2385 2070 2442'>down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled `ORANGE</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 451 2445 2068 2504'>MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 450 2507 2069 2565'>like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 450 2567 1289 2621'>one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class='ocr_par'>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 525 2627 2068 2684'>`Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I shall think</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 449 2687 2065 2743'>nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home!</span>
      <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 448 2747 2066 2803'>Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!'</span>
